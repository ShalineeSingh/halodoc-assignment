      "body": "### Relevant Package\r\nangular/forms\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI think the `ControlValueAccessor` has a performance issue, which cannot be fixed with the current design.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is the following method: `registerOnChange`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ControlValueAccessor {\r\n  registerOnChange(fn: (value: any) => void): void;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe callback has two responsibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Notify the model that the value has been changed.\r\n2. Provide the current value\r\n\r\nThis works fine when you have easy access to the current underlaying value and you can provide the value with each keystroke or change. But it is very problematic in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. The external state is not the same as the internal state. For example editors like Quill or Slate maintain an internal object structure for their state. When you want to write a markdown editor you have to convert the state to markdown with every change, which is expensive. Other editors like TinyMCE are based on the DOM, so you have to convert the DOM to HTML with every change which is also expensive.\r\n\r\n2. The editor itself does not provide a reliable way to get all changes. It could be a bug, but sometimes it is just a feature, for example when plugins make a silent change in Quill.\r\n\r\n3. You can miss changes. For example when you update the form state on blur only to improve performance and then press a submit button, you do not have the latest changes available, because the form has no way to force an update of all values.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to change the signature to this\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ControlValueAccessor {\r\n  registerOnChange(fn: () => void): void;\r\n\r\n  getValue(): any;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows different approaches, for example:\r\n\r\n1. You can call `getValue()` in your change callback to update your model on every change.\r\n2. You can call `getValue()` in your blur callback to update your model on every focus lost.\r\n3. You can convert your change callback to an observable and then use `debounceTime` operator to improve performance.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For backwards compatibility we can either make `getValue()` optional or introduce a `ControlValueAccessor2`.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy build a wrapper of `ControlValueAccessor2` around `ControlValueAccessor1` in angular itself, e.g.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI have not found a good workaround.\r\n",

I have also a button attached to the form container which should be disabled if the form (in the form container) is invalid. The problem is that the form container is valid, although the parent form and its child are invalid. \r\n\r\nOnce I attach any validator to the parent form, the invalid event will be propagated to the form container. I'm not sure if it's a bug but I would expect that if the both forms are invalid (parent and child), the status should be also propagated to the form container and it's not. It's only propagated once the parent form has a validator attached. \r\n\r\nI prepared a stackblitz so that you can reproduce the issue. I would be very grateful if you could comment on that.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-hhfydn",

      "body": "# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nThis feature request is for @angular/platform-browser/animations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nTo make our app start as quickly as possible, particularly on mobile, I've done a bunch of work to minimize initial bundle size. One of the approaches I'm using is async imports (eg `import('../foo/foo.module').then(m => m.FooModule)`) shortly after the app is loaded, for logic that isn't absolutely required for initial load + first render.\r\n\r\nWhile we use angular animations extensively (because it's awesome!), we don't need it for first page view (relying on CSS animations for the first few seconds). It is currently not possible to move the `BrowserAnimationsModule` import to a different module from where `BrowserModule` is imported - because `BrowserAnimationModule` exports `BrowserModule`, and the `BrowserModule` constructor requires that `BrowserModule` hasn't been loaded in a parent injector. Also, angular won't start if `BrowserModule` isn't imported by the root module.\r\n\r\nI would like the ability to delay load `BrowserAnimationsModule`, and I think this would be a useful ability for anyone working to speed initial load.\r\n\r\nThe easiest repro is to create a new project using `ng new --strict --minimal`. Next, `ng build --prod` gives me a main bundle size of 187kB.\r\n\r\nIf I'm going to use @angular/animations in my app, I am currently required to import `BrowserAnimationsModule` in the root module:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\r\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\r\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    AppComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\r\n    AppRoutingModule\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust doing this increases the main bundle to `258 kB` (+71kB or +38%).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to initialize the BrowserAnimationsModule shortly after app load, and have animations work after that point:\r\n\r\n`\r\nawait delay(1000);\r\nimport('@angular/platform-browser/animations').then(m => m.BrowserAnimationsModule );\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis will probably require that the `BrowserAnimationsModule` no longer re-export `BrowserModule`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThe current required configuration works, it just adds unnecessary size to the initial bundle.\r\n\r\nI did try directly importing `BROWSER_ANIMATIONS_PROVIDERS` (which would get around the `BrowserModule` re-import check), but I couldn't access them.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to fork the angular code and try to create a new version of BrowserAnimationsModule that doesn't have these limitations, but I haven't gotten desparate enough for that. We'll see what the Angular team thinks about this proposal.\r\n",

It works fine on devserver start, first rebuild and on build command.\r\nWe faced this for `require` and some webpack typings in our apps after update ng9 -> ng10.\r\n\r\n## 🔬 Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n- clone https://github.com/artaommahe/angular-cli-missing-types-on-rebuild\r\n- open app.component.ts\r\n- start dev server\r\n- no errors\r\n- trigger rebuild (e.g. add comment)\r\n- no errors\r\n- trigger second rebuild\r\n- see type error\r\n\r\nAdding `types: ['node']` solves `require` type error, but you need to add all `@types/*` packages for big projects. `@types/*` should work fine without any additional actions.\r\n\r\n## 🔥 Exception or Error\r\n<pre><code>\r\n    ERROR in src/app/app.component.ts:2:1 - error TS2580: Cannot find name 'require'. Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i @types/node`.\r\n    \r\n    2 require('./test.svg');\r\n      ~~~~~~~\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n<pre><code>\r\nPS D:\\projects\\issues\\angular-cli-missing-types-on-rebuild> yarn ng version\r\nyarn run v1.16.0\r\n$ ng version\r\n\r\n     _                      _                 ____ _     ___\r\n    / \\   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|\r\n   / △ \\ | '_ \\ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |\r\n  / ___ \\| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |\r\n /_/   \\_\\_| |_|\\__, |\\__,_|_|\\__,_|_|       \\____|_____|___|\r\n                |___/\r\n    \r\n\r\nAngular CLI: 10.1.2\r\nNode: 12.18.1\r\nOS: win32 x64\r\n\r\nAngular: 10.1.2\r\n... animations, cli, common, compiler, compiler-cli, core, forms\r\n... platform-browser, platform-browser-dynamic, router\r\nIvy Workspace: Yes\r\n\r\nPackage                         Version\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n@angular-devkit/architect       0.1001.2\r\n@angular-devkit/build-angular   0.1001.2\r\n@angular-devkit/core            10.1.2\r\n@angular-devkit/schematics      10.1.2\r\n@schematics/angular             10.1.2\r\n@schematics/update              0.1001.2\r\nrxjs                            6.6.3\r\ntypescript                      4.0.3\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n**Anything else relevant?**\r\n",
